# check_restart_process
check process existence and restarts
currently this is to check if outlook is still running and restarts if it ain't running anymore.
This of course should be generalized.

ToDo take the process name, check intervalls and some logging options as parameters.
=> process name, check time and wait after process startup until next check is performed can be provided at startup
=> it should work on windows and linux

Open Topics:
# make logging file path as parameter
# What to do if process entered does not exist on startup.
